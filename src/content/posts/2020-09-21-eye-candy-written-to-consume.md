# Choosing a Web Font:

In our epic adventure of learning advanced web development together, we continue our dive into the world of text and typography!

**Typographic Relativism:**

A group of text, even a single word, has a time and place that it is most appropriate to be displayed. Thus, when considering what font you want to use, you must also consider what that text is being used for. Some applications may include...

Blog

Website

Newspaper

Letterhead

Art-piece  

The possibilities are endless, and the way your text is displayed could be the final thing that ties it all together.

Now that you know where your text is going, you must decide how you want your audience to feel. Is this a happy piece of text, cinematic, fun and vivacious, or maybe this is for professional or instructional use. The choice is yours, just make sure the font matches the intent. 

"More than 95% of information on the web is in the form of written language" - Nick Babich

This is important, because while we may not realize it, what we read is a big part of how we ingest and understand the information on the page in front of us. Likewise, you wouldn't write a job proposal in Comic Sans. You can deliver different feelings by deciding whether to bolden text or italicize it, using a larger font size or even a heading can differentiate from the main body of text and a title. These little hints of extra added effort show that you know your audience. 

In addition, if your brand, company, or client has requirements, make sure your choices meet those requirements. 

The font, the way the words come to life, should be held as just as important as the actual meaning of the words while being a reflection of the author.

**Aesthetic and Visual Appeal:**

This is the point where once you have your bones, you get to dress your piece however you want. Go crazy. Just not too crazy. 

You should follow some key guidelines when designing a webpage or piece of development that is heavy with text. 

1. Minimize the Number of Fonts

You should keep in mind the number of different fonts you use on a specific page. Remember, a font is used in a meaningful way so it is important not to contradict feelings throughout the work. In addition, you do not want to confuse or disorient the reader. 

2. CRAP

The keystones of development. Follow CRAP so your work isn't. That is, contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. Make sure there are no outlying words or misaligned text in random places that will draw attention away from the main body of work. Also make sure the overall theme is matched with the fonts used, font size, and placement. 

The idea is to walk away with a meaningful and cohesive piece.
