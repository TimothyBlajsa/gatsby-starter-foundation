# Page Not Found:

We have all experienced this often frustrating phrase

https://codepen.io/g00273900/pen/yLJaXwz

However, the addition of fun or fancy styling can relieve a user's frustration, even doing so much as to prevent the user from clicking off the site

And, as an added bonus, it's super easy!

For our purposes, this brief explanation is specific to Netlify, as the site automatically implements 404 pages, in the case a searched file does not exist or the url is typed wrong; this means all that is required is the creation of a 404.html file.

## Why:

As stated earlier, a custom 404 page could greatly alleviate a user's frustration when a desired page cannot be retrieved

A 404 page can be a fun way to show off a theme or design, however, there are some rules of thumb that a developer should follow

For instance...

* Provide links to pages that do exist
* Do not overwhelm the user, as is the case with any design
* Include a search box
* Include a comment section
* Include contact information
