# Typography's Cousin: website readability

Here we are again my faithful reader(s). I sure hope there is more than one of you out there. Our journey continues on through the amazing world of text, typography, and web development!

**What is readability:**

This article is going to walk us through what readability is. That being said, we are interested in "website readability". This happens to be slightly different than the traditional sense of the words. 

In terms of websites and web development, readability, while also consisting of the ease of reading a particular piece of content, it primarily focuses on what goes into making said content easy to read; such as font, font sizes, and design as opposed to complex vocabulary.

A "readable" website is one that is "legible, readable, and comprehensive". This means that your text copy should be designed clearly and well, have the appropriate sentence structure and vocabulary use, and be written in a straightforward and meaningful way. 

**Why is readability:**

Readability is extremely important when designing a webpage. Whether your design is for a front page, an insert, or a blog like this, there are key reasons to consider when making a website readable. 

1. THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE

When you are writing, you are trying to convince a reader of something; this can be an opinion, fact, or emotion. In terms of business, this can be in the form of converting a reader into a potential customer. This conversion is up to how readable your site is.

2. Accessibility

The next major aspect of creating a text-based piece of work is to make it as accessible as possible. You should prioritize the access of your content; after all, why make something you don't want be seen? You should make something that follows what it means to be readable, as well as the CRAP design pillars and mobile first adaption.

3. Efficiency

The last reason,  but not actually, is the consideration of efficiency in your design. An elegant, well thought out webpage will load more efficiently and smoothly than a massive garble of text and images randomly strewn across the page. Also, outside of the webpage itself, TIME is precious; the page should be designed to achieve all of the previously discussed points within a reasonable amount of time for the reader.

**Tips for Readability:**

Finally, we arrive! How to make a webpage readable.

There are many ways to make a website more readable. It is easier to separate your overall page into two design aspects: CONTENT and DESIGN

The content of your page can be improved greatly by the following...

1. Quick and Concise Information

Your reader does not want to spend time reading paragraphs of text. Give them the tdlr

2. Know Your Audience

This boils down to appropriate word usage and structure.  Make sure your vocabulary is easy to understand and relevant to the content, as well as properly structured with syntax. 

3. Comprehension Beats Complexity

You are not trying to impress your reader, but rather deliver a message to them. Make sure they can fully comprehend the idea that is trying to be conveyed.

The design of your text on the page determines how easy it is to physically look at and digest...

1. Go BIG

When in doubt, choose a legible font and reasonable font size. This can be easily dealt with by using variable fonts.

2. The Way We READ

It has been well known now that humans have an ever decreasing attention span. Use this knowledge to your advantage to make your page easily scannable: bold headers and titles to direct importance and small blurbs or easy to read bullet points to deliver maximum stickability. 

You can also CHUNK content to better organize the more wordy parts of your page.

Tools:

There are various tools available to the developer to test their content for readability. A good resource is the [Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), an online text editor that grades as you edit; another tool includes *[Readable from WebFX](https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/)* which gives you an overall readability score.
